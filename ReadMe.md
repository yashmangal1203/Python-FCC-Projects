# FreeCodeCamp.org Certification Projects.

This Repository is **only** for those projects which are made as part of my FCC certification for Python.

## List of Python Projects for complete certification:

- [x] Arithmetic Formatter
- [x] Time Calculator
- [x] Budget App
- [x] Polygon Area Calculator
- [x] Probability Calculator
  
Code for all projects are available in this repo, all of this code was written by me and I tried my best to explain my process using comments. If you don't understand or have any suggestion please comment!

ReadMe's for each individual project is available inside the folders for better understanding.

All my certification projects are completed. New projects that I start will be in a new repo.
